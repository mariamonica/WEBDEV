    	We have many activities for you to choose from, both on site and area.<br>

        boats that will take you out for either a half day or a full day.You can<br>
        also fish in the the surf. Beware,though, of Ralph! Ralph is our resident<br>
        blue heron.He knows what you fishermen have in your coolers and if you<br>
        aren't careful,he'll take your catch off your hands and make a quick get away <br>

    	We can also arrange dolphin cruises. We have a unique approach-two boats<br>
        go out side-by-side about 50 yards apart.The dolphins love it because it<br>
        generates a huge wake! You'll see them jumping right between the boats<br>
   	    You can arrange for tickets for fishing execusions or dolphin cruises at<br
     
 		 Check out these links for area attractions that are very kid-friendly<br>
     	 Watch the Blue Angels practice. Call for information on dates and times.<br>
